I really like the show because it is thought provoking and i like shows that make me think
The cast.
Nothing
It is the most complex and original idea I have ever seen or heard of. Also, because it delves into the topic of human emotions, but in an artificial way, if I were to be punny and serious all at once. From what I have seen of the show, I believe that we, as human beings, can compare ourselves to the androids, because we can definitely relate to them.
it has many twists and I like that
It's unpredictable so you are left wanting more
